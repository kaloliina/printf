# ft_printf

## Project Overview

Printf is a project that involves recreating the standard C library function printf. The goal of this project was to understand and implement the functionality of printf from scratch, including handling various format specifiers and flags.

## My Approach

I began reading about variadic functions and how to actually use them. I started with the basic implementation of printing strings and then moved on to dealing with format specifiers that I was the most familiar with. As that was done, I then proceeded to investigate how hexadecimals and void pointer conversion works.

## Learnings

- Variadic Functions: I had no idea you could even have variadic functions until I worked on printf! It was really cool to learn how to handle a variable number of arguments. It opened up a whole new world of possibilities for writing flexible code.

- Conversion Processes: I gained insight into how hexadecimal conversions work, which, although similar to the decimal system, required understanding the base-16 number system.

## Future Directions

At this moment, I'm not entirely sure what I would like to build upon in this project! I may regret saying this now, but according to my current skills, I felt the code was formatted in a clear and concise way, including the error check if write function fails.

## How to Run the Project

- Setup Instructions: To use my printf implementation, clone the repository and compile the source files using the provided Makefile.

- Usage Examples: Include my printf function in your projects by linking against the compiled library and using it in your code.
